#### A basic Youtube clone page featuring basic element embedding

## About

This is a basic page clone project that copies the general view of a Youtube video. It features plain HTML image & video embedding and common elements. The page is as simple as it can be without a responsive design; it's just for an introduction to HTML.

**Live Page:** [GitHub Hosting](https://fsolm.github.io/embedding-images-and-videos/)

## Installation

All the necessary files are in the root directory, just open the HTML file.

## Known Issues

As mentioned earlier, this is a basic project: it wasn't developed with responsive design in mind, so it may look different depending on your viewport's width and will, most likely, break on a mobile phone.

## Planned Implementations

None, the goal of this project was completed and it's not necessary to revisit it.
